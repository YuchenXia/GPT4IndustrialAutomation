This repository contains the demos of the paper "**Towards an Autonomous System: A Flexible Modular Production System Enhanced with Large Language Model Agents.**"

> :pushpin: The paper has undergone peer review and is scheduled to be published in **IEEE-ETFA2023** (The 28th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES) - The International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation) Track - Artificial Intelligence for Cyber-Physical Systems in Automation.

You can find the original **pre-print draft** of the manuscript at this link: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370417635_Towards_autonomous_system_flexible_modular_production_system_enhanced_with_large_language_model_agents) for public discussion within the research community.

> :calendar: The peer-reviewed version will be published by IEEE after the conference, which is set to take place from September 12th to 15th, 2023. We've made several improvements to the final version of the paper based on valuable feedback and suggestions from other researchers. Note that the final version will be exclusively published by IEEE.
